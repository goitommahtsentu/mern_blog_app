                            10-man Arsenal came within a minute of claiming their first win at the Etihad Stadium since
                            2015 but a late John Stones equaliser saw us have to settle for a point after an incredible
                            performance.

                            A crazy opening 45 minutes saw Erling Haaland hand the hosts a ninth-minute lead, but we
                            fought back and after a rocket from Riccardo Calafiori on his full debut drew us level,
                            before Gabriel once again headed in a corner to get us in front.

                            However in the final second of the half Leandro Trossard was controversially dismissed for a
                            second bookable offence for delaying the restart, leaving us to battle with 10 men for 45
                            minutes.

                            Despite relentless pressure, we held firm for all of those and six of the seven added on at
                            the end of the half, but John Stones scrambled home an equaliser to deny us a famous win.

                            An early warning sign saw Ilkay Gundogan spin past Gabriel to set himself up for a volley
                            which he shanked well wide, but in the ninth minute we fell behind.

                            Savinho skipped past Calafiori, broke infield and slipped a pass behind our backline for
                            Haaland to run onto, and he bore down on goal before nudging the ball past David Raya to hit
                            double figures in just five league games.

                            We were under the cosh in the early stages and Gundogan when wrapped a free-kick against the
                            post as City attempted to find a second, but they were dealt a blow when Rodri was forced
                            off with a knee injury after an innocuous coming together with Thomas Partey on 20 minutes.

                            And we swiftly capitalised as when play resumed, a quickly-taken free-kick from Partey
                            caught City napping. Gabriel Martinelli was able to get to the edge of the box and lay the
                            ball back to Calafiori, who bent a delicious shot into the top corner from 20 yards out that
                            left Ederson clutching thin air
